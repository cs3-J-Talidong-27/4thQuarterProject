            <h1> About This?</h1>
            <p> Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematics, computer science, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.</p>

                    <h3> Brief History</h3>
                    <p>The term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by Eric L. Schwartz in 1985 during a conference in Carmel, California, to summarize the state of a field previously known by various names. The first international meeting on this topic was organized by James M. Bower and John Miller in 1989, and the first graduate program was established at Caltech in 1985. The field's roots trace back to pioneers like Louis Lapicque, who introduced the integrate-and-fire model in 1907, Hodgkin and Huxley, who modeled the action potential, Hubel and Wiesel, who studied the visual cortex, and David Marr, who developed computational theories of neuronal interactions. Wilfrid Rall furthered the field with computational modeling of neurons and dendrites.</p>

                    <h3> Importance and relevance of the field</h3>
                    <p>Computational neuroscience plays a crucial rule in the field,because it integrates experimental neuroscience with theoretical modeling to unravel complex brain functions and behaviors. By developing mathematical models and simulations, it allows researchers to predict neural behavior, understand neurological disease mechanisms, and create innovative treatments. This field is vital for advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning through brain-inspired algorithms, and it supports the development of technologies like brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics. Additionally, it enhances our understanding of cognitive processes, providing insights that improve educational methods and cognitive therapies, thereby bridging the gap between basic neuroscience research and practical applications.</p>

                    <h3> 3 Main Goals</h3>
                    <p>1.) Understanding Neural Mechanisms: Developing models to elucidate how neurons and neural circuits function and interact to produce behavior and cognitive processes.
                        <br> 2.) Predicting Neural Behavior: Creating simulations that can predict how neurons and neural circuits will respond under various conditions, both normal and pathological.
                        <br> 3.) Advancing Artificial Intelligence: Inspiring algorithms and models in AI and machine learning by mimicking brain processes to improve computational efficiency and intelligence. </p>

it's one amazing experience. Well, being in neuroscience field itself, you might call me biased.

Yes, I am a bit biased.

But, after doing masters in pure animal science subject, I realized that neuroscience is one of that field which can keep you hooked all your life. It can amaze you every single day. It's so vast that you will always feel hungry and will never get full of it.

It teaches us how beautiful is an amalgamation of physics, chemistry and biology in it's mechanics. Since the beginning of neuroscience by a simple sketch of a neuron by Ramón y Cajal, to the brain see- through techniques developed till today, has paved it's path from learning basics to breaking social taboo of mental health stigma.</p>

                            It’s….complicated haha

In general every neuroscientist should tell you it’s great. You don’t go into science for the money or the glamour, you science out of passion, you love what you do. If you don’t love it you’re gonna have a bad time and most likely a new job pretty fast.
