            <p>
			Computational neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the function and mechanisms of the nervous system through mathematical models, computer simulations, and theoretical analysis. This field bridges neuroscience, mathematics, computer science, and physics, drawing on the strengths of each to address complex questions about brain function and cognition.
			<br>1. Neuroscience: At its core, computational neuroscience seeks to elucidate how neural circuits process information, generate behavior, and contribute to cognitive functions. Researchers in this field use experimental data from neurobiology, such as electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, to inform and validate their models.
			<br>2. Mathematics: Mathematical tools and techniques are essential for creating models of neural activity. Differential equations, linear algebra, and statistical methods are commonly used to describe the dynamics of neurons and networks, as well as to analyze the behavior of these systems under various conditions.	
			<br>3. Computer Science: Computational neuroscience relies heavily on computer science for simulating complex neural models and analyzing large datasets. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly being used to interpret neural data, develop brain-machine interfaces, and understand the principles of learning and adaptation in the brain.
			<br>4. Physics: The principles of physics, especially statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory, are crucial for understanding the emergent properties of neural networks. Concepts from thermodynamics and chaos theory help researchers explore how large-scale patterns of neural activity arise from the interactions of many individual components.			</p>
