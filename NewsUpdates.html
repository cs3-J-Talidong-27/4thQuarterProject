			<h1> About Neuroscience</h1>
            <p> Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematics, computer science, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.</p>

			<h1> Case Studies and Applications</h1>
            <p>Computational neuroscience is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand brain function and cognition through computational models and techniques. Case studies and applications in computational neuroscience are diverse and span various areas of research and technology development. Here are a few examples: </p>

                    <h3> Neural Network Models of Memory:</h3>
                    <p>Computational neuroscientists have developed models based on artificial neural networks to simulate memory processes in the brain. These models help understand how memories are formed, stored, and retrieved, and they have applications in developing AI systems with memory capabilities.</p>

                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3> Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs):</h3>
                    <p>BCIs are systems that enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. Computational neuroscience plays a crucial role in developing algorithms to interpret neural signals and translate them into commands for controlling prosthetic limbs, computer cursors, or other devices. Case studies involve individuals with motor impairments using BCIs to regain control and improve their quality of life.</p>

                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3> Deep Learning and Brain Imaging: </h3>
                        <p> Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are being applied to analyze brain imaging data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). These models can identify patterns in brain activity associated with specific tasks or cognitive states, aiding in understanding brain function and diagnosing neurological disorders.
